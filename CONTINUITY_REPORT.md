## 🏗️ OVERLAY ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Core Pattern: Base Screen + Intelligence Overlays

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Header (~80px)                     │ ← Persistent (except BuildingDetail/Map)
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Hero Cards (~200px)                │ ← Role-specific metrics
│  [Card 1] [Card 2]                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Context Card (~150px)              │ ← Role-specific context
│  [Weather/Portfolio/System]         │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Intelligence Tabs (~100px)         │ ← Collapsed tab bar
│  [Tab1][Tab2][Tab3][Tab4][Tab5]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
TOTAL: ~530px (< 1 scroll) ✅

When tab clicked:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Header (stays visible)             │ ← z-index: 1000
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  OVERLAY SLIDES UP (300ms)          │ ← z-index: 100
│                                     │
│  Full-screen content                │
│  based on selected tab              │
│                                     │
│  [X Close]  [Swipe Down ↓]         │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Overlay Behavior
- **Animation**: Slide up 300ms with fade-in
- **Dismissal**: Tap same tab, X button, or swipe down
- **Z-Index**: Overlay (100) < Header (1000)
- **Coverage**: Covers Hero + Context, but NOT header

### Boiler Walkthrough Inspection Integration

**Use Case**: Building walkthrough inspections can now:
- Identify which buildings require boiler inspections
- Track boiler blowdown schedules
- Route inspectors efficiently based on boiler locations
- Account for shared boiler relationships in maintenance planning

## 🗑️ GARBAGE COLLECTION LOGIC

### Bin Set-Out Requirements

**Buildings Requiring Bin Set-Out** (9 buildings with <9 units):
```
Building                | Units | Set-Out Required | Reason
------------------------|-------|------------------|------------------
104 Franklin Street     | 5     | ✅ Yes           | Commercial, 5 units
138 West 17th Street    | 8     | ✅ Yes           | Mixed-use, 8 units
68 Perry Street         | 5     | ✅ Yes           | Residential, 5 units
123 1st Avenue          | 4     | ✅ Yes           | Mixed-use, 4 units, walkup
136 West 17th Street    | 8     | ✅ Yes           | Mixed-use, 8 units
133 East 15th Street    | 9     | ✅ Yes           | Residential, 9 units

```

**Buildings with Standard Pickup** (9 buildings with ≥9 units):
```
Building                | Units | Set-Out Required | Reason
------------------------|-------|------------------|------------------
12 West 18th Street     | 16    | ❌ No            | Standard building-side

```

### Garbage Collection Data Model

**buildings.json field**:
```json
{
  "id": "6",
  "name": "68 Perry Street",
  "numberOfUnits": 5,
  "garbageBinSetOut": true  // <9 units = bin set-out required
}
```

## 💰 PROPERTY VALUATION SYSTEM

### Valuation Methodology

**Unit-Level Aggregation for Condos**:
- Each condo unit valued based on Manhattan neighborhood comparables
- Total building value = sum of all unit values
- Assessed value = 50% of market value (NYC standard for condos)
- Taxable value = 90% of assessed value (10% exemptions)

**Manhattan Neighborhood Pricing** (Per Unit):
```
Neighborhood           | Price/Unit
-----------------------|------------
Chelsea                | $2.0M
Tribeca                | $2.8M
West Village           | $2.8M
Lower East Side        | $1.8M
East Village           | $1.5M
Soho                   | $2.5M
Nolita                 | $2.2M
Union Square           | $2.0M
Chelsea South          | $2.0M
```

### Portfolio Valuation Results

**Total Portfolio Value**: $447.0M (corrected from $500.6M)

**Key Corrections**:
```
Building              | Old Value | New Value | Change    | Reason
----------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------
68 Perry Street       | $33.6M    | $14.0M    | -$19.6M   | 5 units, not 12
133 East 15th Street  | $52.0M    | $18.0M    | -$34.0M   | 9 units, not 26
```

**Top 5 Most Valuable Buildings**:
```
1. 131 Perry Street (West Village)       | $52.9M | 18 res + 1 comm
2. Rubin Museum (Chelsea - HQ)           | $45.0M | Commercial
3. 117 West 17th Street (Chelsea)        | $42.0M | 20 res + 1 comm
4. 112 West 18th Street (Chelsea)        | $42.0M | 20 res + 1 comm
5. 41 Elizabeth Street (LES Commercial)  | $42.0M | 28 commercial
```

            : 'Standard building-side pickup'}
        </Text>
      </View>
    )}
  </View>
</View>
```

```typescript
boilerCount: (building as any).boilerCount || 0,
boilerLocation: (building as any).boilerLocation,
sharedBoilerWith: (building as any).sharedBoilerWith,
sharedBoilerBuildingId: (building as any).sharedBoilerBuildingId,
sharedBoilerProviderFor: (building as any).sharedBoilerProviderFor,
