## 🔍 **SWIFTUI RECONCILIATION GUIDANCE**

### **📋 Development Principles**

#### **1. Read Full SwiftUI Files Before Implementation**
- **ALWAYS** read the complete SwiftUI source file before creating React Native counterparts
- Understand the full scope, architecture, and functionality before writing
- Identify the core purpose and business logic, not just UI patterns

#### **2. Avoid Redundancies - Use Existing Systems**
- **DO NOT** create new systems if existing ones can be enhanced
- **MODIFY** existing implementations to evolve rather than creating duplicates
- **CONSOLIDATE** similar functionality into unified systems
- **REUSE** existing managers, services, and components

#### **3. Evolution Over Mirroring**
- **DO NOT** mirror SwiftUI just for the sake of mirroring
- **ENHANCE** existing React Native implementations if they're better
- **IMPROVE** upon SwiftUI patterns when React Native offers better solutions
- **FOCUS** on functionality and user experience, not exact code structure

#### **4. SwiftUI Source Analysis Process**
1. **Read Complete File** - Understand full scope and functionality
2. **Identify Core Features** - Extract essential business logic
3. **Check Existing Implementation** - See what's already built in React Native
4. **Enhance vs Create** - Modify existing or create new based on gaps
5. **Maintain Consistency** - Ensure uniform glassmorphism dark style
