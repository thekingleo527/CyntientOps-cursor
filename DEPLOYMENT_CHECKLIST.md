## **üö® BLOCKERS (Address Immediately)**

### **Critical Path Items**
1. **Supabase Project Setup** - Blocks backend integration
2. **NYC API Keys** - Blocks real data testing
3. **ViewModel Integration** - Blocks user workflows
4. **Photo Storage** - Blocks photo upload feature

### **Owner Actions Required**
- [ ] Create Supabase project (10 min)
- [ ] Gather NYC API keys (30 min)
- [ ] Test one complete workflow (2 hours)
- [ ] Review ViewModel integration points (1 hour)

---

## **üìù NOTES**

### **Known Issues**
- 957 console.log statements remaining (not critical, but should clean up)
- 42 TypeScript `any` types (should fix in critical paths)
- Some navigation flows untested
- WebSocket reconnection needs real-world testing

### **Decision Log**
- **2025-10-01**: Decided to use EAS instead of npm builds
- **2025-10-01**: Implemented LoggingService to replace console statements
