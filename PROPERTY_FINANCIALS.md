## üöÄ DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES (Unused FAR)

### What is FAR?
**FAR (Floor Area Ratio)** = Buildable area √∑ Lot size. Unused FAR means vertical expansion potential.

### Top 6 Development Opportunities

| Rank | Building | Unused FAR % | Current FAR | Max FAR | Est. Value Increase |
|------|----------|--------------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Building 17** | 62% | 2.49 | 6.60 | $3,021,780 |
| 2 | **Building 3** | 45% | 5.41 | 10.00 | $4,188,150 |
| 3 | **Building 1** | 37% | 6.29 | 10.00 | $4,831,825 |
| 4 | **Building 18** | 30% | 4.90 | 7.00 | $2,226,000 |
| 5 | **Building 11** | 27% | 6.15 | 8.50 | $1,539,000 |
| 6 | **Building 10** | 20% | 5.60 | 7.00 | $1,466,667 |

**Total Development Potential:** $17,273,422 in value creation

### Analysis by Property

#### Building 17: 178 Spring Street (HIGHEST POTENTIAL)
```
Current Value: $4,869,000
Unused FAR: 62%
Current: 2.49 FAR | Max: 6.60 FAR
Expansion Potential: 165% (2.65x current size)
Estimated Value After: $7,890,780 (+$3,021,780)
```

**Considerations:**
- Currently has DOB violations ($14,687) - MUST resolve first
- SoHo location = high construction costs but strong demand
- Historic district restrictions may apply
- Vertical expansion could yield 10-12 additional units
- ROI Estimate: 20-25% over 3 years

**Action Plan:**
1. Resolve current DOB violations
2. Feasibility study ($15,000)
3. Historic district approval process
4. Architect + structural engineer ($50,000)
5. DOB permits and approvals (6-12 months)

---

#### Building 1: 12 West 18th Street
```
Current Value: $13,058,987
Unused FAR: 37%
Current: 6.29 FAR | Max: 10.00 FAR
Expansion Potential: 59%
Estimated Value After: $17,890,812 (+$4,831,825)
```

**Considerations:**
- Ladies' Mile Historic District = strict approvals
- Already 9 floors, strong foundation may support 3-4 more

Current: 5.41 FAR | Max: 10.00 FAR
Expansion Potential: 85%
Estimated Value After: $13,495,150 (+$4,188,150)
```

**Considerations:**
- Renovated in 1988 = good bones
- 6 floors currently, could go to 10-11
- Chelsea location
- 14 residential units could expand to 24-26

---

√∑ 0.45 (NYC ratio)
= Market Value: $13,058,987
```

### Why Assessed < Market?
- Tax benefit for property owners
- NYC policy to reduce tax burden
- Standard across all residential properties
