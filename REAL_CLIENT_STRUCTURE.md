  footer?: string;
  managerName?: string; // "Report prepared for: Stephen"
}

async generateComplianceReport(

  return {
    id: buildingId,
    name: 'Sample Building',
    address: '123 Main St, New York, NY',
  };
}

// NEEDED:
private async getBuildingData(buildingId: string): Promise<any> {
  const property = PropertyDataService.getPropertyDetails(buildingId);
  if (!property) throw new Error('Building not found');

  return {
    id: property.id,
    name: property.name,
    address: property.address,
    marketValue: property.marketValue,
    assessedValue: property.assessedValue,
    units: property.unitsTotal,
    yearBuilt: property.yearBuilt,

}
```

  return {
    score: 88,
    lastInspection: new Date(),
    issues: [],
  };
}

// NEEDED:
private async getBuildingComplianceData(buildingId: string): Promise<any> {
  const violations = ViolationDataService.getViolationData(buildingId);

  return {
    score: violations.score,
    hpdViolations: violations.hpd,
    dobViolations: violations.dob,
    dsnyViolations: violations.dsny,
    outstanding: violations.outstanding,
    issues: this.convertViolationsToIssues(violations),
