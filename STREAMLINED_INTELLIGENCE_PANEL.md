# 🧠 Streamlined Intelligence Panel

## Overview

The Intelligence Panel has been streamlined from 7 tabs to 5 tabs, with Quick Actions centered for better UX and consolidated functionality.

## Tab Structure

### **Before (7 Tabs):**
```
Portfolio | Quick Actions | Routines | Site Departure | Schedules | Insights | Alerts
```

### **After (5 Tabs) - Streamlined:**
```
Portfolio | Schedule | Quick Actions | Insights | Site Departure
```

## Consolidation Changes

### **1. Routines + Schedules → Schedule Tab**
- **Before**: Separate "Routines" and "Schedules" tabs
- **After**: Single "Schedule" tab combining both functionalities
- **Content**: Daily schedule, weekly routines, building-specific tasks
- **Data**: Hydrated with worker's assigned buildings and task schedules

### **2. Insights + Alerts → Insights Tab**
- **Before**: Separate "Insights" and "Alerts" tabs  
- **After**: Single "Insights" tab with alerts section
- **Content**: AI recommendations, performance analytics, active alerts
- **Data**: Consolidated Nova AI insights with real-time alerts

### **3. Quick Actions Centered**
- **Position**: Moved to center of tab bar for prominence
- **Content**: 
  - 📸 Take Photo (Task Evidence)
  - 📝 Vendor Log (Vendor Access)
  - 📋 Quick Note (Quick Note Taking)
  - 🚨 Emergency (Emergency Reporting)
  - + Add Action (Custom Actions)
- **Data**: Building-specific quick actions based on current location

## Tab Order (Left to Right)

1. **Portfolio** (🗺️) - Building map and assignments
2. **Schedule** (📅) - Daily schedule and routines (consolidated)
3. **Quick Actions** (⚡) - Common worker actions (centered)
4. **Insights** (💡) - AI insights and alerts (consolidated)
5. **Site Departure** (🚪) - End of day workflow (last tab)
