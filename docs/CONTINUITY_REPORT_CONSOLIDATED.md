## 🏗️ **Code Implementation Updates (2025-10-11)**

### 🔧 Post‑update Items (2025-10-12)

- Added unit tests in `@cyntientops/business-core`:
  - OperationalDataService normalization test to ensure “148 Chambers St/Street” variants resolve to the same building ID.
  - TaskService schedule bucket test (now/next/today/urgent/completed) with time mocks and urgency threshold checks.
- Documentation index added under `docs/README.md` to keep root README links valid.

### 🔗 Deep Linking & Navigation

- Added deep link scheme and linking config:
  - `apps/mobile-rn/app.json` → `scheme: "cyntientops"`
  - `apps/mobile-rn/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` → `NavigationContainer` with `linking` (screens: login, dashboard, building/:id, task/:id, profile).

### 🗄️ Supabase Provisioning Status

- Project is created and partially updated (verified tables: buildings, clients, offline_queue, cache_entries, supply_requests, clock_in, issues, compliance, photo_evidence, audit_logs, security_events).
- Scripts available to complete provisioning:
  - `scripts/supabase-schema.sql`, `scripts/cleanup-and-deploy.sql`.
- Programmatic migrator available:
  - `packages/database/src/SupabaseMigration.ts` (creates tables, indexes, RLS).
- Core schema parity test added:
  - `packages/database/src/__tests__/schemaParity.test.ts`.

### 🧠 Nova Q&A – Next Phase Plan

Goal: Nova answers operational questions using live data + weather + historical DB, with retrieval‑augmented grounding.

1) Extend schema
   - Add `knowledge_documents` / `knowledge_chunks` (pgvector embeddings),
   - Decide on `nova_insights/prompts/responses` parity vs. consolidated knowledge tables.

2) Edge functions
   - `/nova/ask` (router + tools + retrieval), `/nova/ingest`, `/nova/embed`.

3) Ingestion & RAG
   - Ingest compliance issues, building/worker notes, routine descriptions, curated photo evidence metadata.

4) RN wiring
   - `useNovaAsk(question)` hook with streaming text + citations panel.

Status: Deep link config + schema parity test in place. Proceed to schema extension + functions.
