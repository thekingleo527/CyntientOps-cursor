## 🏗️ **Code Implementation Updates (2025-10-11)**

### 🔧 Post‑update Items (2025-10-12)

- Added unit tests in `@cyntientops/business-core`:
  - OperationalDataService normalization test to ensure “148 Chambers St/Street” variants resolve to the same building ID.
  - TaskService schedule bucket test (now/next/today/urgent/completed) with time mocks and urgency threshold checks.
- Documentation index added under `docs/README.md` to keep root README links valid.

### 🔗 Deep Linking & Navigation

- Added deep link scheme and linking config:
  - `apps/mobile-rn/app.json` → `scheme: "cyntientops"`
  - `apps/mobile-rn/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` → `NavigationContainer` with `linking` (screens: login, dashboard, building/:id, task/:id, profile).

### 🗄️ Supabase Provisioning Status

- Schema now includes knowledge tables (`knowledge_documents`, `knowledge_chunks`), DSNY datasets, compliance alerts, and audit-safe triggers.
- CLI tooling:
  - `scripts/run-supabase-migration.ts` – applies schema via `exec_sql`.
  - `scripts/backfill-knowledge.js` – ingests buildings/workers/tasks/compliance/DSNY + weather snapshots.
  - `scripts/analyze-knowledge.ts` – runs `ANALYZE knowledge_chunks`.
  - `scripts/refresh-knowledge.js` – one-shot helper (migration → backfill → ANALYZE) for cron/CI.
  - `scripts/embed-knowledge.js` – optional embeddings via OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- Type-safe migrator (`packages/database/src/SupabaseMigration.ts`) mirrors the SQL (extensions, RLS, triggers) for automation.
- Existing schema parity test still passes (`packages/database/src/__tests__/schemaParity.test.ts`).

### 🧠 Nova Q&A – COMPLETE ✅

Goal: Nova answers operational questions using live data + weather + historical DB, with retrieval‑augmented grounding.

1) Extend schema ✅
   - Knowledge + DSNY/compliance tables, RLS, triggers, and deterministic IDs shipped via migration script.

2) Ingestion & RAG ✅
   - `scripts/backfill-knowledge.js` populates Supabase with portfolio data and live weather snapshots; triggers keep knowledge up to date.

3) RN wiring ✅
   - Building overview tab: Supabase knowledge highlights (building, DSNY, compliance, weather)
   - **NEW:** Operations tab: "Operations Insights" with task/DSNY/worker knowledge
   - **NEW:** Compliance tab: "Compliance Insights" with compliance alerts and violations
   - All tabs use source_type filtering for contextual results
   - Files updated: `BuildingOperationsTab.tsx`, `BuildingComplianceTab.tsx`

4) Edge functions / scheduling ✅
   - **NEW:** `supabase/functions/refresh-knowledge/` - Full knowledge refresh
   - **NEW:** `supabase/functions/weather-refresh/` - Hourly weather updates
   - Deployment guide: `supabase/functions/README.md`
   - pg_cron examples for automated scheduling

5) Embeddings pipeline ✅
   - **Enhanced:** `scripts/embed-knowledge.js` with modern OpenAI SDK
   - Batch processing, rate limiting, pgvector checking
   - Setup guide: `docs/EMBEDDINGS_SETUP.md` with full SQL migrations
